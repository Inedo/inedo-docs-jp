        BuildMaster lets you release your software reliably, to any environment, at whatever pace the business demands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Build a self-service release management platform by allowing different teams to manage their own applications and deploy to their own environments.     
    </p>
    <p>
        Start simple and then scale to thousands of servers and the cloud.  
    </p>



      <h3>Here is a Short Guide to get you Started Quick:</h3>


      <p>
          In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a simple ASP.NET web application along with its IIS configuration through a pipeline to create a repeatable release process.

          BuildMaster will install on any supported version of Windows; simply <a href="/buildmaster/download" target="_blank">download</a>, and click through the installer to get BuildMaster up and running in minutes. Through the installer, you select the edition you wish to install; a trial, the free edition, or enter a license key. Review the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/installation/windows-guide" target="_blank">step-by-step Installation Guide</a> for details as to what's happening behind the scenes.

      <h3>Agents and Servers in BuildMaster</h3>
      <p>
          To deploy releases to your servers, BuildMaster needs to be able to communicate with those servers over a fast and secure channel. There are a few options for doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
          The Inedo Agent is generally the best way to communicate with a <i>Windows server</i>. It's a lightweight, highly-optimized agent that is simple to deploy and upgrade, but is also backwards- and forwards-compatible to minimize change risks. Alternatively, BuildMaster can use <i>PowerShell Remoting</i> to communicate with Windows servers; however, this is generally slower and less resilient than the Inedo Agent protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
          To communicate with Linux servers, BuildMaster uses <i>SSH</i> and <i>SFTP</i>, and if you're using BuildMaster to interact with the server it's installed on, you can just set it up using a <i>local agent</i>.
      </p>
      
      
      <!-- <h3>Building from Source</h3> added after Alex writes his paragraph
      <p>
          If you're not already automating your builds, then BuildMaster can retrieve code from source control, build it, and run unit tests.
